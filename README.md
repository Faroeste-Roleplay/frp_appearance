## Why is it escrowed?
> I spent a long time developing and refining this character creation/clothing store.
> 
> I organized all the components so that the clothing items are separated by color.
> 
> After a long time of work, I reached this result in the character creation process.
> It will be released for free (escrowed) for everyone using the FRP Framework, but to also compensate for all my effort and work in this character creation, I decided to release it as open-source for those who wish to purchase and adapt it to their framework or server.
> 
> The open-source version will be paid, and it cannot be distributed in any way on the internet, as this would violate the script licenses and my work;
> 
> Below are photos and a demonstration video of how it works.
> 
> Its data-saving structure in the DB is completely different from the conventional methods used by frameworks today;
> I will leave the structure of the SQL file below.
